Welcome to the digital realm, where pages turn with the swipe of a finger, as we proudly introduce the very first e-magazine to grace the halls of any Indian medical college.

On behalf of the editorial board, we welcome you to the official transcript of our very first podcast of "the Articulate" taken by our members- Mansi Garg, Soumya Ajmera, Siddhi Kiyawat and Purvi Verma taking the interview of our 2020 batch university topper Vandita Ruia.

Starting with our interview, 

**Q1) Did you always want to be a doctor?**

 I wanted to be a doctor since childhood, a major part of which goes to seeing my elder sister in this field who inspired me the most.

**Q2) Since your elder sister chose this stream you must have had some idea of how college would be, so what were your expectations? Did they meet?**

I didn't have expectations regarding college, although I did see myself being independent and enjoying the freedom. But it turned out to be exact opposite, I felt homesick almost every day.

**Q3) How did you balance fun and studies?**

I was studious during my first year, I didn't know how to balance. As a result I missed out on a lot of fun, in my opinion you should make friends and you should find balance unlike me.

**Q4) What advice would you like to give to the new batch 2023 who is about to start this journey?**
Don't have too many expectations, they would break. Also try to have a lot of friends so that you can go to anyone whenever you feel low. But you should study conceptually that too from day 1, find a balance.

**Q5) We used to study a lot during our UG-NEET preparation. Did you change your study routine when you transitioned to college in first year?**

To me my routine was very much similar. You should be consistent like you were during your preparation. Also you should study conceptually. The difference lies that during NEET you focus only on the important ones but here try to gain knowledge rather than running after important questions and marks. Don't mug up, try to have knowledge about anything you can have.

**Q6) What is your opinion on books - should you go for standard books or other books meant just for passing?**

In my opinion, go for standard books and try to build concept that's how you'll score well, studying a day before won't earn you good marks.

**Q7) Which book did you prefer in your first year? And what was your approach?**

Starting with physiology, I used Guyton since the start and Ganong for some topics but at the end came down to Indhu Khurana for university, however I took Guyton as my sole standard book for physiology.
For anatomy, I used BD Chaurasia and for biochemistry I followed Satyanarayan.
I stuck with these books throughout the year, and I advise the same - choose one book and stick with it.

**Q8) What was your routine after college? How do we make it?**
I didn't have a particular routine as such, what you can do is rest 4-6 and then till 8pm you can study for 2 hours before dinner and after that you can chill. Also try to sleep early at least by 11. Get up early and dedicate 1 hour in the morning for studying.

**Q9) What was your motivation to be consistent with your routine?**

My biggest motivation was my parents and my sister who is very hardworking, she inspired me the most. Secondly, I feel when you are disciplined from within you enjoy it, and then it becomes a routine.

**Q10) How to balance social life and college life?**

Try studying daily and utilize your holidays for socializing. Don't force yourself to study on days you don't feel like.

**Q11) Your first year was mostly spent in lockdown at home due to Covid, so how did you motivate yourself without any social life?**

Being at home, your parents motivate you to study, so they were my motivation, I also didn't have many friends then, so it didn't affect me that much.


**Q12) Were your study hours same at home and here?**

"Yes"

**Q13) How did you manage practical classes online?**

During that time, we had practicals of those topics which didn't require much physical presence. So it was not much of an issue.
When we came back we had practical classes in full swing.

**Q14) What was your revision strategy?**

When you study every day, you get ample time to revise, so when you are consistent you'll get time to revise.

**Q15) How did you utilize your College time productively?**

Some classes are actually beneficial, so you should listen to them. Rest you have to attend because of attendance, you can't escape it. What you can do is utilize the free time in studying.

**Q16) Should we take any online subscriptions in first year or stick to textbooks?**

I guess you should focus on textbooks rather than video lectures, because you should learn to read the books first.


**Q17) Have you taken any subscriptions?**

"No, not until now, I am thinking though"

**Q18) What was your first experience when you saw cadaver? Were you scared?**

I wasn't scared, it was a normal experience, the smell of formalin was an issue though.

**Q19) Do you have any memory of any practical exam you would like to share?**

During our pre-university, in anatomy practical examination I went to respected Dr. Vijay Sir, I answered every question to which he appreciated me and asked ma'am to take my viva first, so the whole class was sitting as I was completing my viva first. I was very happy that day, it was such an overwhelming experience.


**Q20) How did you gain this much confidence in anatomy?**

Not just anatomy, I was confident regarding any subject as I used to revise many times, so I guess that was my strength.

**Q21) After talking to you, we feel you'll excel in whatever field you go in, have you thought of any specialization you would want to pursue in future?**

I want to be a cardiac surgeon or a neurosurgeon.

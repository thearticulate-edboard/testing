So this year, after I got selected, I decided to gift myself by fulfilling my bucket list. 
And got my ear pierced for the 2nd time.. initial days wear painful, I was trying my level best to adjust with it, trying myself to accomodate with the little pain I was experiencing. Was it worth?? Ofcourse yes! 
It was making me feel happy, it was enhancing my beauty, it was getting me lots of compliments. Everything was going smooth except the little pain that I was experiencing every night while sleeping.. somewhere it was like 
नींद चुराई मेरी किसने, ओ, सनम? तूने!!!!
After continuous throbbing pain, one night I started crying and went to my mom saying that this is hurting me too much.. after she inspected it, she said that it is because the piercer pierced on my conch rather than the upper lobe and because of that bony part it's taking time to heal.. after a few days, I got it removed.
And now I am waiting for it to heal so that I can get my ear pierced again... 
Don't you think life works in same way? People come in your life, give you lots of temporary happiness and our oxytocin level is so high that we usually ignore the minor inconveniences and toxicity for the sake of love.. In the long run when the pain becomes unbearable we end up with a broken heart cursing our stars and God. After a heart-break , we should not stop exploring love rather we should take time for it to heal. Doing anything that makes you happy is never a bad option but remembering if that happiness is temporary or permanent is important.

summary: "A mesmering trip, boating and all"
---

Dholawad dam is one of the major tourist attractions of Ratlam.
üìç Dam is situated 25 km towards west of Ratlam.
The dam is surrounded by lush greenery üå≤üå¥.
During monsoon, you can even enjoy boating in the rising waves of lake which costs Rs.50 per round.

Environment of the dam gives you utmost peace and serenity when you sit nearby coast of lake. It's very mesmerizing when you experience cool and breezy waves of wind.

We started from college for our 25 km journey with lots of excitement and curiosity. Once we reached the dam we bought the entry tickets costing Rs.20/- per head and then proceeded to trek towards coast of the lake. The way to the lake was surrounded by nature in its incredibly beautiful self. Once we reached there we settled on the coast of lake and had some good old-fashioned fun of throwing stones at the lake. We went on to experience the thrill of boating and towards the end of it, rains started pouring heavily. We stood on the top of the rock enjoying three beautiful faces of nature - wind in the air, rain from the sky and water beneath us. Our trip winded up but not before enjoying some corn and ice-cream at the site.

It was a wonderful experience and everyone should visit there once during monsoon. ‚ú®Ô∏è

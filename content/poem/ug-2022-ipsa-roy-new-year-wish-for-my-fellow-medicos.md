Another year is gone; it's finally past.
It sometimes seemed a grind, sometimes a blast.
In the New Year, let's resolve
 to get less stressed, upset, anxious
 about things over which we have no control.
Another year, another chance
 To start our lives anew;
 This time weâ€™ll leap old barriers
 To have a real breakthrough.
I hope for your fulfillment,
Contentment, peace and more,
A brighter, better new year than
You've ever had before.

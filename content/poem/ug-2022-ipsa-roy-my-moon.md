The Moon will shine,
Without your smile,
But no longer shall it be.
A Moon that shines for me,
You turned out to be the Moon,
in a Universe full of Stars
and When you touched My Wounds,
they vanished along with My Scars.
The moon whispers stories of the stars
And I tell him tales of you,
The boy who stole my heart
And parted the clouds
To see the sun.
The moon talks about you,
In a way I could never.
A full moon is like you and me,
One half for you the other for me
A full moon is like moon cheese,
Yes, yes, yes, I love moon cheese
And I love you as well because you
Are my ease.

As a reader Ilike to explore the generes. Among them I'm stuck at an autobiography which is lovingly and beautifully written by a teenager girl.

Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani female education activist and survivor of hideous attack by Talibans. She is the youngest Nobel prize laureate.

I Am Malala written by Malala Yousafzai is a story of the girl who stood up for the education and was shot by the Talibans. It is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of fight for girls' education and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons. This autobiography is the mix of political and historical facts and personal reflections. It has beautiful touch of history of pashtuns. The book has helped to broaden my mental horizon. 

Malala's story is both inspiring and heart breaking. I personally admire her courage and tenacity. Her anecdotes are also chronicles of the hardships and danger faced by people of the seat valley and the people of entire Pakistan as well.

The book is originally written in English but it has been translated in more than 40 languages alongwith Hindi.

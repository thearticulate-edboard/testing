Our dad's are so less expressive so I decided to write A poem which explains every father's emotions for their daughter.
The sentences in the poem are the one which my dad says to me.

Do you know how much you mean to me?
As you grow into what you will be.
You came from within, from just beneath my heart.
It's there you'll always be, though your own life will now start.
You're growing so fast it sends me a whirl,
With misty eyes I ask, where's my little girl?
I know sometimes to you I seem harsh and so unfair,
But one day you will see, I taught you well because I care.
The next few years will so quickly fly,
With laughter and joy, mixed with a few tears to cry.
As you begin your growth to womanhood, this fact you must know,
You'll always be my source of pride, no matter where you go.
You must stand up tall and proud, within you feel no fear,
For all your dreams and goals sit before you very near.
With God's love in your heart and the world by its tail.

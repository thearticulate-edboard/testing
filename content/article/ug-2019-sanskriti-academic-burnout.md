## Academic burnout among medical students

Medical students are still advised to persevere through their battle with burnout despite the overwhelming strain brought on by long study sessions, consecutive bombardment of tests, competitive environment, and the ever-evolving nature of medicine. The negative impacts of postgraduate medical burnout can soon affect the college and the local community. The learning environment degrades when pupils are physically exhausted and have high levels of skepticism. First-year medical students are likely to develop unfavorable attitudes if students aren’t provided with proper support for dealing with stress.

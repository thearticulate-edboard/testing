With Himalayas in the north
Indian ocean in the south
Arabian sea in the west
Bay of Bengal in the east.
I love my nation

With developed culture
And beautiful sculpture
The people have no rest
To do their work best.
I love my nation

They give us rice in ration
They dress in latest fashion
They do many inventions
Which are about fiction.
I love my nation

With number of hill station
Which are Godâ€™s creation
It give us protection
And save us from tensions
